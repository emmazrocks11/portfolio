                <p>As a university student myself, I understand and experience the issues that rise when it comes to balancing education and living necessities. The topic that my team and I chose to tackle was the need for affordable groceries as a university student.</p>

            <h4 class="btw-header-p">Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>Grocery shopping is an essential part of university student life, and can pose problems when it comes to managing financial constraints. University students have noticed that groceries have become more expensive, and having that on top of tuition and housing expenses affects their nutrition. According to CBC News, food prices in 2025 could increase by 5% (Heydari 2024). Existing research shows that food costs are on the rise, and in consequence affordability becomes an important factor when it comes to grocery shopping. <br><br>

            According to Investopedia, buying in bulk does decrease the cost per unit, but often leads to overconsumption and waste. As a result, students miss out on savings.<br><br>
                
            Our app addresses these challenges by providing a platform where users can find grocery deals, easily find others interested in splitting bulk groceries if needed, coordinate purchases, and handle payments seamlessly. By facilitating collaborative shopping, the app promotes financial savings, sustainability, and good grocery shopping habits.

                    <p>Through a series of conducted interviews, three participants were asked to share their grocery shopping situation as a university student. The first aim was to understand different grocery situations and methods used by university students who shop for themselves. This includes their journey from start to finish, and—if they do—how they find affordable groceries, be it flyers, coupons, online or physical. The second aim was to identify what in their personal experience works, and what does not.</p>
